This is a Sopel IRC Bot module which supports Wikimedia Global Sysops.

The bot functions to assist Global sysops in checking the Category for speedy deletions across any and all Wiki?edia projects. The bot can report those articles found in the categories to an IRC channel or on their talk page at meta.wikimedia.org.

# Dependencies

This module requires Python3.x and libraries: json, requests, time, random, sqlite3, urlparse, and OAuth1. Additionally, this module depends on a sqlite database which is not yet included in this repo. A future update will introduce an example database file.

# WYSIWYG

I'm not a professional programmer. At best, I think of myself as a Python hacker. Everything I write is pretty muched a hack job. If you notice something that could be improved or fixed, please either fix it, or open an issue for me to fix it. Thanks.
